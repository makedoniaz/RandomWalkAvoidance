# RandomWalkAvoidance

This program is designed for graph analysis, specifically for modeling random walks. It computes the probability of reaching a target vertex _B_ from a starting vertex _A_ while avoiding a restricted vertex _ùê∂_. This tool can be valuable for researchers in graph theory, network analysis, or those studying the behavior of complex systems.
